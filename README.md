# Responsive-Portfolio
Hey everyone! So this is my most recent attempt at the first homework assignment and using twitter bootstrap for the responsive design of my page. I finally was able to make a page that resembles the first homework assignment and has responsive design minus the issues with my bio text (the positioning) of that as well as my picture and the sticky footer.

I did not get anywhere really with the twitter bootstrap however I did understand its purpose and super handy-ness, given it is much simpler and gives you everything you want or need from a CSS Framework.

So as far as installation goes, you need first and foremost Github; you need to download Visual Studio Code so you can write your code for HTML pages as well as your CSS and GitBash if you have Windows and * Terminal for Mac owners because it makes it easier to commit, pull and push to your Github and locate your directories, etc. You will also need Bootstrap as that is where you will be pulling your command syntax from for whatever you need whether it is your navbar, your buttons, dropdown for your menu (should you want it), etc.

I got help from some classmates, but still struggled so I did get a lot of help to understand those concepts further from mmtuts and The Net Ninja on Youtube as well as Bootstrap.com itself.

Again its not much, but I hope you enjoy the improvements. Thanks!
