                Bienvenidos a mi pagina! My name is Isabel Gomez, I'm 24 years old and I was born and raised in Los Angeles, California. I am first generation Mexican American as my parents hail from Mexico. At the age of 18, after graduating high school, I ran off with a little circus called Cavalia Odysseo and I worked with them until I was 21. I then came back to Los Angeles and started working at a middle school that was Math,Science and Technology based for a year and a half. It was then that I knew it was time for me to start getting serious about pursuing my dream and career in development. Some of my interests include watching and playing sports (baseball, hockey, soccer and softball) going to concerts, music festivals and travelling. I hope to hone my skillset to become a web and game developer.
